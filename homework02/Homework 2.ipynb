    "The next goal is to merge the two dataframes that were created in the previous tasks using university names.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first observe that a straight forward approach based on equality of the names is insufficient, because there might be slight differences in the names. For example, the MIT is referred to as 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)' in the Top Universities ranking, while it referred to as 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology' in the Times Higher Education ranking. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we need a more sophisticated method for matching names. We decided to first compute all possible combinations of universities, i.e. the cross product of the two dataframes, and then filter on a refined criterion. For every combination of universities a metric for the similarity between their titles is computed using the `ratio` function provided by the difflib Python standard library. The core functionality of this library is to calculate matching parts in sequences. This is achieved by searching for the longest common subsequence and then recursivly looking for matches left and right of the occurence of this sequence. (This is based on Gestalt pattern matching<sup>1</sup>). \n",
    "The ratio of similarity is then computed using the formula 2.0 * M / T where M is the number of matches and T is the sum of the lengths of the two strings. This results in a number between 0 and 1 where 1 means that the two strings are equal. We then define a threshold for the point from which on two names are considered to describe the same university. We set this threshold to be 0.8. The threshold was found by manually checking the quality of the matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach works well apart from a few exceptions. In particular, there were some mistakes for titles which consist mainly of words which are very common in university names. For example the names 'University of Bern' and 'University of Bonn' would match. Therefore, we decided to further refine our method by deleting those common words from the titles before computing the ratios. We delete the words 'University', 'Institute', 'of', and 'The'.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it is difficult to create a perfect approximation, there still are some entries in the end which need to be added or deleted manually.  In total the result has 144 rows, where two rows had to be deleted manually and five rows were added manually. We consider this a satisfactory accuracy. \n",
