# Inside the Leak!

<h2>Inspecting clusters' behavior throughout the years</h2>
We choose to analyze the behavior of the 50 most involved countries, keeping only the top 5 countries for each cluster. Cluster number 3 is composed only by <b>Seychelles</b> since the other members of the cluster are not included in the 50 most involved.

The graphs in the figures above show the amount of incorporations and inactivations that each country has registered throughout the years. Remembering that each country is assigned to a specific cluster based on the geographical displacement of its offshore accounts, we can state that the geographical displacement of accounts influence their number, in terms of incorporations and inactivations.
  
Furthermore, countries belonging to the same clusters show similar trends on the size of their movements, both for incorporations and inactivations. However, all the clusters behave in a similar way for what concern their trends throughout the years. More precisely:

<ol>
  <li>All the clusters reached their maximum number of incorporations in the years between 2005 and 2007</li>
  <li>Clusters 1 and 2 reached their highest value for inactivations in 2010</li>
  <li>Cluster 3 reached the highest number of inactivations in 2015</li>
  <li>Cluster 4 reached the highest number of inactivations in 2006</li>
</ol>

<h2> Investigating the interest throughout the years</h2>
News involving leaks and scandals might inevitably influence the behavior of the countries involved. In this section we analyse countries' behavior after this events, throughout the years.
<h3>The majority of the countries has decreasing trend</h3>
