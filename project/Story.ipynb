    "# Inside the Leak\n",
    "\n",
    "As global markets expand and become more interconnected, businesses are increasingly looking for resources to help identify competitive and profitable opportunities. Several data leakages in the last years have shown that a common approach to this is the creation of offshore companies, i.e. companies created in low-tax, offshore jurisdictions.\n",
    "Our goal is to analyze motivating factors for creating\n",
    "such offshore entities. We believe that a better understanding of the reasons can help to find ways to deal with those tendencies. This has an impact on the social good, because fiscal prudence and opennesss in international trade can have a powerful effect on improving society.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis is based on data provided in the [Offshore Leaks Database](https://www.occrp.org/en/panamapapers/database) [1]. It contains information about 500,000 offshore companies, foundations and trusts including links to people and companies in more than 200 countries and territories. The information comes from the Panama Papers, the Offshore Leaks and the Bahamas Leaks investigations cunducted in the years 2013 to 2016. While those data leaks contain diverse sorts of documents from emails to bank documents, the database provides only structured overview information excluding the raw files themselves. The latest investigation on the Paradise Papers that was released in November 2017 is not included in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to better understand the underlying structures of the offshore business we analyze the available data on the level of countries. We identify the most involved countries and try to find factors that characterize those countries. To this aim we enrich the dataset with information about the economical and social background of countries from the [Index of Economic Freedom](http://www.heritage.org/index/about) [2].\n",
    "Furthermore, we investigate how the different countries are connected and how their presence in the offshore business evolved in the last years. In particular, we wanted to see whether the publication of the leaks influenced those developments in some way."

    "## International relations\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now take a closer look at how the different countries are connected. We measure the connectedness of two countries by the number of offshores coming from one country founded in the other country.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, we want to see if there is a pattern in the way players in origin countries select special countries for their offshores. Therefore, we cluster the origin countries into groups with similar selection information using k-means clustering. \n",
    "\n",
    "The selection patterns of the four resulting clusters are visualized in the matrices below. Each row corresponds to an origin country and each column to a goal country. The color of a cell indicates for the corresponding origin country the relative frequency of offshores that where founded in the corresponding goal country.\n",
    "\n",
    "And indeed it is easy to see a pattern that characterizes the countries which are in the same  cluster: The first cluster contains those countries where the majority of offshore entities are founded on the British Virgin Islands. The second cluster contains the countries with most offshore entities in Panama, the third those countries with a mojority of entities on the Seychelles. The countries in the fourth cluster show more diverse distributions of destination countries. However there are still interesting patterns. For example, for many countries in this cluster the main destination of entities is the country itself, see for example the Cook Islands or Samoa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know that the countries can be categorized by the way jurisdictions for offshores are selected, an obvious question to ask is what causes those different structures. In other words, we want to know how the countries that are in the same cluster are similar to each other and different to the coutries in other clusters. This in turn could help us to find the underlying factors that motivate the selection of destination countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we consider as a possible factor is geographical closeness. To this means we draw a map<sup>1</sup> where the color of each country represents its cluster. Countries colored in white do not occur in the database and therefore do not belong to any cluster. We observe that most South American countries (Brasil being the most apparent exception) have the majority of offshore entities in Panama (Cluster 1). In Northern America and the UK, most offshore entities are founded on the British Virgin Islands. So indeed geographical closeness might be a factor. Other interesting observations include that most of the countries in Cluster 2 are African. The only exceptions are Bulgaria and the Seychelles (which is also the most popular tax haven in these countries).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The next possible factors we consider are of economical nature. We investigate which influence the economic factors specified in the Index of Eonomic freedom data set have on the assignment to the clusters. There are several ways to tackle this question. One approach we took was to do a multinomial logit which predicts the cluster from the economical factors. As economical factors, we considered the gross domestic product (GDP), the GDP growth rate, government expenditures, the infalation, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow and the public debt. We then interpreted the coefficients of the classifier. It turned out that none of the mentionned factors have a significant influence. Another approach is to do a principal component analysis (PCA). A PCA considering the three main factors can be visulized as follows, where every point corresponds to a country and the color indicates its cluster:\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to the previous analysis, it is difficult to see a pattern in this. Therefore, we conclude that the economic factors we analyzed have no influence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in general this kind of reasoning only enables us to restrict the set of possible factors, while it does not enable us to identify the relevant factors with certainty. This would require more background research by experts. We still think that the map is a good basis to detact interesting tendencies. For example, starting from there one could try to see whether countries belonging to the Commonwealth of nations belong to the same cluster. We observe that the UK, India and Australia are in the same cluster. However, Canada is not. One can think of many questions like this considereing the historical and political background of countries.\n",

    "We analyzed the underlying structure of the offshore businesses on a country level. The Bahamas, the British Virgin Islands, Panama, and the Seychelles were identified as the most involved jurisdictions. On the other hand the most involved origin countries with respect to the outflow of entities are Hong Kong, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Luxembourg and the United Arab Emirates. A closer investigation showed that the most involved countries have common economical characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how the countries are connected to each other we clustered them according to the distribution of the offshore entities to jurisdictions.  This resulted in four clusters with clear selection patterns. Taking a closer look into the geographical location of the countries in each cluster we found that the countries that are relatively close show similar behaviour in how they invest. However, we could not find any significant relationship between the patterns and the economic characteristics of the countries. We think that other important influencing factors might be found in the historical and political background of the countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing the fluctuations of the number of active offshore entities over time we found that countries which were in the same cluster showed similar trends. Interestingly, we can find similar patterns across the clusters, in particular we see a general increase in the amount of incorporations up-to 2008, and a sudden decrease afterwards. Considering that 2008 is the year when the global financial crisis occured led us to think that there might be a link between the net amount of established entities and the stock market. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, future work to extend this analysis includes integrating the latest data which was made available in the Paradise Papers leak. We think that experts in international relations and economy might be able to find more in-depth explanations for the interesting insights we found."
