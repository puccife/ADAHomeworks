# Reasons for opening offshore companies

# Abstract
The goal of this project is to analyze motivating factors for creating offshore companies, i.e. companies created in low-tax, offshore jurisdictions. The analysis is performed using the Offshore Leaks Database (https://www.occrp.org/en/panamapapers/database) which contains data about almost 500,000 offshore companies, foundations and trusts from the Panama Papers, the Offshore Leaks and the Bahamas Leaks investigations. We plan to consider economic as well as legal factors. To this end we enrich our dataset with information about the economic and legal background of countries from the Index of Economic Freedom project (http://www.heritage.org/index/about). 
While it is often unclear whether the offshore entities are legal, it is a fact that tendencies to create companies in tax havens abroad have a bad effect on the local environment, as the local government loses tax money. This money would in turn benefit the inhabitants of teh country. Therefore, the general social good is affected.  We think that a better understanding of the reasons which lead to the creation of offshore companies can help to prevent this tendencies.


# Research questions
1. Which economic factors motivate the foundation of offshore companies? 
2. Which role does the legal situation in the origin country play compared to the legal situation in the offshore country? In particular, are off-shores used also to avoid  higher wages and better working conditions imposed by countries legislation?
3. How are the countries connected? Is there a pattern in the way players in origin countries select special countries for their offshores?
4. There is a hypothesis that scandals involving tax havens actually help to promote creating offshores there. See for example http://www.isa-world.com/news/?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=1&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=198&cHash=10b412a7de63d3b2a02adf0d120a09f6. Can we find evidence for this in the data?

# Dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

# Questions for TAa
We think that it would be interesting to do a more detailed analysis taking into account a distinction for different sectors of industry. However, we did not find a good way to find out the sector an entity in the panama papers belongs to. In particular, we would need to enrich the dataset somehow. (Note that there is a column named company type in the panama papers data set, but it is all empty.) Can you point us to other data sets possibly containing this information?
